# DVD Rental — SWI-Prolog Web App

A complete DVD rental management system built with SWI-Prolog.

**Showcase:** This project is a showcase of how well Prolog can be generated by an AI agent. Because the domain is mainly logic — facts, rules, queries, and state transitions — it fits Prolog’s model closely, so an agent can produce clear, maintainable code with domain logic in one place and accidental complexity (HTTP, HTML) kept separate.

## Requirements

- [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) 8.0+

## Running

```bash
cd prolog-dev-rental
swipl server.pl
```

The server starts automatically on port 8080.
Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.

## Project structure

```
domain.pl          Domain logic: data, business rules, queries, commands
server.pl          Web layer: HTTP server, routing, HTML rendering
static/style.css   Stylesheet
```

**domain.pl** is the single source of truth for everything the business cares
about: films, actors, categories, customers, inventory, rentals, availability
checks, and the rent/return operations.

**server.pl** contains all accidental complexity: HTTP plumbing, URL routing,
parameter parsing, HTML generation, and redirects.

## Features

- Browse and search 20-film catalog
- Filter films by category (Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, ...)
- Film detail pages with cast, availability, and inline rent form
- Customer directory with per-customer rental history
- Rent films (with inventory/availability enforcement)
- Return films
- Dashboard with live stats

## Sample data

The app ships with 20 films, 15 actors, 10 customers, 47 inventory items,
and a handful of pre-existing rentals (some active, some returned).
All data lives in `domain.pl` as Prolog facts — no external database needed.
